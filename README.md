## Course Information

Mobile Application Development Using C# introduces students to programming for mobile devices. Building on studentsâ€™ previous programming knowledge in C#, this course explores a broad range of topics, including mobile user interface design and development; building applications that adapt to different mobile devices and platforms; managing data using a local database; and consuming REST-based web services. In this course, students will focus on developing skills using the latest framework designed to provide a more modern and streamlined development experience. This framework will help students design and code cross-platform applications that work on a range of mobile devices. There are several prerequisites for this course: Software I and II, and UI Design.

### Competencies

**Introduction to Mobile Development**

The graduate develops a simple mobile application using an integrated development environment (IDE).

**User Interfaces**

The graduate develops a user interface for a mobile application.

**Managing Data**

The graduate creates solutions to store, retrieve, and transmit mobile application data.

**Supporting Devices and Platforms**

The graduate develops an application that accounts for different platforms and device conditions.

### Scenario

For this task, you will develop a multiple-screen mobile application for WGU students to track their academic terms, courses associated with each term, and assessments associated with each course. The application will allow students to enter, edit, and delete term, course, and assessment data. It should provide summary and detailed views of courses for each term, provide notifications for upcoming performance and objective assessments, and notify students of deadlines and tracking milestones even after the application is closed. You will create a wireframe as a visual guide, representing the skeletal framework of the application. Your application will use an SQLite database using the SQLIte ORM located at SQLite-net.

### Requirements

* Utilize GitLab for project management
* Draw a low-fidelity wireframe for your mobile application
* Create, within the .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) framework, a mobile application aligned to the wireframe
* Provide an interface for academic terms and courses
* Provide an interface that allows the user to access all the following features for each academic term
* Provide an interface that allows the user to access and edit all the following details for each course
* Create features that allow the user to enter assessments and set due dates
* Write code to create a set of data for evaluation and testing purposes
